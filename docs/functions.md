## [Functions](./../functions.js)

## Function Declaration
1) Function declarations load before any code is executed
2) function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code

## Function Expression
1) A function expression can be stored in a variable.
2) Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name i.e. function names are optional
3) Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code 
4) Function expressions arenâ€™t hoisted

## Benefits of Function Expressions
There are several different ways that function expressions become more useful than function declarations.
As closures
As arguments to other functions
As Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

## Return
1) A function doesn't have return it returns undefined value 

## Nested Function

## Function Scope
Local Variables will disappears once its function execution got completed
